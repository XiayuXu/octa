Introduction to the OCTA dataset:
The OCTA-AV database includes two datasets. Specifically, The first dataset was collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, consisting of 110 normal eyes. For each eye, OCT angiography (3.0×3.0 mm optic disc-centered, 320×320 pixels) and the corresponding color fundus image (FOV of 45o, optic disc-centered, 2576×1934 pixels) were captured. The second dataset was collected at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat-sen University. For each eye, OCT angiography (6.0×6.0 mm optic disc-centered, 320×320 pixels) and corresponding fundus image (FOV of 45o, optic disc-centered, 1634×1634 pixels) were captured. For each case, arteriole/venule segmentation was given in C_Annotation (e.g., red for arterioles and blue for venules).
